Git Essentials: Working with Local and Remote Repositories

Git is a distributed version control system that enables efficient collaboration and code management. Here's a comprehensive guide to essential Git operations:

1. Local Repository Commands:
   - git init: Initialize a new Git repository
   - git add <file>: Stage changes for commit
   - git commit -m "message": Save staged changes
   - git status: Check repository status
   - git log: View commit history

2. Remote Repository Operations:
   - git remote add origin <url>: Connect to remote repository
   - git push -u origin main: Push local changes to remote
   - git pull: Get updates from remote repository
   - git clone <url>: Copy a remote repository locally

3. Branch Management:
   - git branch: List all branches
   - git checkout -b <name>: Create and switch to new branch
   - git merge <branch>: Combine branch changes
   - git branch -d <name>: Delete a branch

4. Best Practices:
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Pull changes regularly to stay updated
   - Create feature branches for new work
   - Review code before merging to main
   - Keep commits focused and atomic

Remember to always verify your remote repository configuration with 'git remote -v' and ensure you have the proper permissions before pushing changes.
